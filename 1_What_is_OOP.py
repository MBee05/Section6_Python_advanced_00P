# What is OOP?

# in python we can create your data type ex own class
print(type(None))
print(type(True))
print(type(5))
print(type(5.5))
print(type('hi'))
print(type([]))
print(type(()))
print(type({}))



# class
class BigObject:  
    pass

        # #create new obj.-> instanciate
        # I can create many obj based on the BigObject
        # instancitate means we are calling the class to create an object
obj1= BigObject()
obj2= BigObject()
obj3= BigObject()

        # instancitate 
print(type(BigObject))  
print(type(None))
print(type(True))
print(type(5))
print(type(5.5))
print(type('hi'))
print(type([]))
print(type(()))
print(type({}))
print(type(obj1))

#  all these are data type and everything are an object=have diff method and attribute that u can access with .method
